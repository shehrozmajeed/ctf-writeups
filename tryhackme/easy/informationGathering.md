# 🟢 TryHackMe – Easy Rooms

This folder contains writeups and notes for **Easy-level TryHackMe rooms**, mainly focused on foundational penetration testing concepts.

---

## 🎯 Focus Area: Information Gathering (Recon)

These rooms emphasize the **first phase of ethical hacking** — collecting as much information as possible about a target before exploitation.

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts Learned

* Passive vs Active Reconnaissance
* OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
* Identifying attack surfaces
* Web and network enumeration basics

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

### 🔹 Dirsearch / Dirb (Directory Enumeration)

Used to discover hidden files and directories on web servers.

**Example:**

```bash
dirsearch -u http://target.com
```

**What it helps with:**

* Finding admin panels
* Discovering hidden endpoints
* Locating backup/config files

---

### 🔹 Shodan

A search engine for internet-connected devices and services.

**Example Queries:**

```
apache 2.4.49
port:22 country:PK
```

**What it helps with:**

* Finding exposed servers
* Identifying open ports/services
* Gathering OSINT data

---

### 🔹 Nmap (Network Scanner)

Used for scanning targets to find open ports and running services.

**Example:**

```bash
nmap -sC -sV target_ip
```

**What it helps with:**

* Port scanning
* Service/version detection
* Initial vulnerability discovery

---

### 🔹 Whois

Used to get domain registration and ownership details.

**Example:**

```bash
whois example.com
```

---

### 🔹 DNS Enumeration (nslookup / dig)

Used to gather DNS-related information.

**Example:**

```bash
nslookup example.com
```

---

## 🧠 Skills Gained

* Performing structured reconnaissance
* Using multiple tools for better results
* Understanding how attackers gather information
* Building a strong foundation for penetration testing

---

## 📌 Notes

These rooms are beginner-friendly but very important.
Strong reconnaissance skills make later stages (exploitation & privilege escalation) much easier.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Move to Medium-level rooms
* Learn vulnerability scanning tools
* Start basic exploitation techniques
